# Texas-Holdem
ASCII version of Texas Holdem
This project was created as part of the final for a software engineering course. The task in this project was to implement an ASCII version of the game of our choice in groups of 2 - 3, using the Eiffel programming language. Me and my partnered chose to design and implement an ASCII version of Texas Holdem.
